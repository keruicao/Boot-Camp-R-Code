Problem 1: Discrete distribution
x      p(x)
1      0.50
2      0.30
5      0.15
10      ??

(a) Find P(x=10)

P(x=10) = 1 - (P(x=1) + p(x=2) + p(x=5)) = 1 - (.5 + .3 + .15) = .05

x <- c(1,2,5,10)
p.x <- c(.5,.3,.15,NA)
p.x[4] <- 1 - sum(p.x, na.rm = TRUE)


p.x =  0.5 0.3 0.15 0.05

(b) What is the expected value?

weighted.mean(x, p.x) = E(x) = 2.35

problem 2

A basketball player is practicing 3-pointers. If the probability that he
successfully scores each shot is 4/5

(a) What is the expected value of the points he scores after 100 shots?

The distribution of successful shots is binomial with p=0.8.

E[x] = np = 100*.8 = 80

(b) What is the probability that the player has 20 misses (out of the 100 shots)?

P(x=80) = choose(100,80)*.8^80*.2^20 = dbinom(80, 100, .8) = 0.099

Take a look at the distribution.

Start R and examine the distribution.
plot(dbinom(0:100, 100, .8))
plot(pbinom(0:100, 100, .8))
set.seed(2019)
x <- rbinom(1000, 100, .8)
hist(x)
p <- dbinom(0:100, 100, .8)

weighted.mean(0:100, p)
